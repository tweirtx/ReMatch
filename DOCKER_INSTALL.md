#Docker-based setup
Docker is the recommended method to set up your ReMatch environment, especially on POSIX systems.
Setup is extremely simple and, assuming Docker is installed correctly, is guaranteed to work.

## Before you continue
This step should be obvious. Install Docker from [this link](https://docs.docker.com/install/) based on the instructions
for your OS.

## Setup

If you're on Linux or macOS, run ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweirtx/ReMatch/master/docker_up.sh && sudo chmod +x docker_up.sh```

If you're on Windows, download [this Powershell script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweirtx/ReMatch/master/docker_up.ps1).

## Usage
Whenever you want to bring up the ReMatch docker file, simply run the script you downloaded for your system.
